Items can be crafted from other items at anvils.

There is a percentage of a chance to fail in making an item and wasting the resources, a better crafting skill lessens that chances.
Better items will have a much higher chance to fail.

On succesfully crafting an item, a hammer sound and sparks should spring up from the anvil.
On failing to craft an item, a dull hammer sound will play without sparks.
