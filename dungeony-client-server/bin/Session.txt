A session represents a running game.

Composition
===========
- The levels that are inhabited by players.

Each session can have multiple active levels at one time, and players can be spread across different levels.

Each level will have an exit that is a ladder down (in boss room) and an entrance that is a ladder up (not on first floor)
Interacting with either of these will move a player into a previous level or an upcoming level.

If at any point a players health reaches 0 then they are kicked from the session.
