Character skins will all be the same but only differ in colour per player.

Characters will have:
- 10 inventory slots.
- 1 primary slot (weapon)
- 1 secondary slot (shield or charm)
- 1 armour slot (chestplate or boots or gauntlets)
- 1 accessory slot (buff or pendant or ring)


Charcters can earn experience which that can use to spend on skill points.
Each earned point means more experience is required to earn the next.
Points could be used on:
- Another health point
- Another defense point
- Another speed point
- Another attack point
- Another magic point
- Another luck point
- Another stealth point
- Another crafting point
- Another alchemy point
Each player starts with one point for each.

Players can also find/buy bestiary pages, each of which is associated with one enemy category.
On using this item, the player will gain a skill point for that enemy category which helps towards:
1. Attack dealt to that enemy.
2. Ability to avoid being spotted by that enemy.
3. Increase item/resource drops from that type of enemy.
