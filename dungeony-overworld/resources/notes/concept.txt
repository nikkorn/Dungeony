A swipe in a cardinal direction means walk one tile in the swiped direction if not blocked.

Depending on what inventory slot is selected, tiles will be highlighted that the player can perform an action on. 
E.g. If the selected item is a dagger then every enemy/interactable within a tile radius (N,S,E,W) will be highlighted and the player can click on one to use the item on it.
E.g. If the selected item is a bow AND the ammo slot contains some valid ammo then every enemy/interactable within a range (mabe based on bow/ammo quality) (N,S,E,W) will be highlighted and the player can click on one to shoot at it.

Consumable items are used by selecting them, maybe twice? or maybe the player will be highlighted if one is selected and the player has to click on them?

whole inventory is shown in box at bottom of display. Either:
-- helmet, armour, ammo, trinket slots.
-- 12 selectable (only one at a time) slots on which items can be equipped and unequipped to helmet, armour, ammo, trinket slots or used as part of a swipe. Weapons are equipped simply by making them the selected item.
