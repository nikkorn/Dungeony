OVERVIEW
==================================================

A swipe in a cardinal direction means walk one tile in the swiped direction if not blocked.

Depending on what inventory slot is selected, tiles will be highlighted that the player can perform an action on. 
E.g. If the selected item is a dagger then every enemy/interactable within a tile radius (N,S,E,W) will be highlighted and the player can click on one to use the item on it.
E.g. If the selected item is a bow AND the ammo slot contains some valid ammo then every enemy/interactable within a range (mabe based on bow/ammo quality) (N,S,E,W) will be highlighted and the player can click on one to shoot at it.

Moving a tile, using a consumable or attacking all count as a player action, in response to which every other entity in the area can also do an action (e.g. move, attack player).

Consumable items are used by selecting them, maybe twice? or maybe the player will be highlighted if one is selected and the player has to click on them?

whole inventory is shown in box at bottom of display. Either:
-- helmet, armour, ammo, trinket slots.
-- 12 selectable (only one at a time) slots on which items can be equipped and unequipped to helmet, armour, ammo, trinket slots or used as part of a swipe. Weapons are equipped simply by making them the selected item.


==================================================
AREA
==================================================

An area consists of 10*15??? tiles.

Each tile, for example a door, has:
- A type. (e.g. door)
- A variation which is a string defining a subtype, e.g. a stone wall variation may be "VERTICAL", "HORIZONTAL", "TOP_LEFT_CORNER", which will most likely just be used to determine sprites.
- A description which might show when the tile is selected.
- A getSprite() method that returns the tile sprite which can change based on internal tile state. (e.g. open, locked, smashed)
- An isWalkable() method that returns whether entities can walk over the tile. (e.g. returns true if open or false if locked)
- An isInteractable(Item item) method that gets whether the tile is interactable with the give item. (e.g. using a shield on the door would return true and the app could give a negative beep or something)
- An onInteraction(Item item) method that is called when an item is used on the tile and returns a flag defining whether the item was consumed. (e.g. using an approproate key item will update the door to be unlocked and returns true because a key was used up.)
- An onWalkedOn(Entity entity) method that is called when an entity first moves onto the tile when it is walkable.
- A getAreaLink() method that returns an optional area link object that refers to another area and position that would have a corresponding area link that moves the player to the linked area when the tile is talked on.
- A getContainer() method that optionally gets a container of takable items.

==================================================
WORLD
==================================================
The world consists of many generated areas that are positioned in an x/y grid.

There can be many x/y grids interconnected via area links attached to tiles within areas.

Being at the edge of an area and attempting to move the off of the area will move the player into the adjoining area.
TODO How do we link up free edge tiles between areas? Do we have always have an optional set 2 per side? 
- The way we can do this is that some tiles around the edge of an area can be left walkable which means that they have to connect to walkable tiles in the adjoining area. But, tiles 
  around the edge of an area can be not walkable (e.g. tree) BUT be marked as replacable with walkable tiles if it means that it can be linked to another area. For example tile A with 2 walkable tiles
	on its east side can connect to a tile with no walkable tiles on its west side IF the 2 non-walkable tile positions are replacable.
	
In order for an area to be attacked to another, the touching walkable tiles on both areas MUST be the same tile type? Thi swould be good for enforcing
that connecting areas are kind of similar. 


Area Difficulty
===============
The difficulty of an area can increase (more likely) or descrease (less likely) based on the parent area that it is linked to.

The colour of tiles in an area will be between green and red and will depend on the relative difference of difficulty with the previous (parent) area.
e.g. 
 - moving to an area 3 or more levels higher that the previous one will have a red theme.
 - moving to an area 2 levels higher that the previous one will have an orange theme.
 - moving to an area 1 level higher that the previous one will have a yellow theme.
 - moving to an area with the same level as the previous one will have a blue theme.
 - moving to an area with a lower level that the previous one will have a green theme.
